## Computational Biology Blog

I'm a first year Masters student studying agricultural biogeochemsitry. My research focuses on utilizing a combination of best management practices (i.e., tillage, manure application/timing, and incorporating cover crops during the off season) in order to mitigate nutrient losses via greenhouse gas emissions, improve soil fertility, and increase crop yield.
