Question 1: The primary reason for using Excel to set up data frames is that people like to have the columns aligned. However, if there are not too many columns, it may be faster to do the job in a plain text editor first and align the columns with tabs. In your text editor, type in (or copy and paste from here) the following lines of text:
```
First String    Second      1.22      3.4
Second          More Text   1.555555  2.2220
Third           x           3         124

FIND: \s{2,} # find two or more spaces after a character
REPLACE: , # replace spaces by seperating with a comma

First String,Second,1.2,3.4
Third,x3,124
```



Question 2: A True Regex Story. I am preparing a collaborative NSF grant with a colleague at another university. One of the pieces of an NSF grant is a listing of potential conflicts of interest. NSF wants to know the first and last name of the collaborator and their institution.
```
Ballif, Bryan, University of Vermont
Ellison, Aaron, Harvard Forest
Record, Sydne, Bryn Mawr

FIND: (\w+), (\w+), (.*)
REPLACE: \2 \1 (\3)

Bryan Ballif (University of Vermont)
Aaron Ellison (Harvard Forest)
Sydne Record (Bryn Mawr)
```



Question 3a: A Second True Regex Story. A few weeks ago, at Radio Beanâ€™s Sunday afternoon old-time music session, one of the mandolin players gave me a DVD with over 1000 historic recordings of old-time fiddle tunes.The list of tunes (shown here as a single line of text) looks like this:
```
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3 0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3 003 Cherokee Shuffle.mp3 0004 Walking Cane.mp3

FIND: mp3 
REPLACE: mp3\n
  
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3
0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3
0003 Cherokee Shuffle.mp3
0004 Walking Cane.mp3
```

Question 3b: Now write a regular expression to grab the four digit number and put it at the end of the title:
```
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3
0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3
0003 Cherokee Shuffle.mp3
0004 Walking Cane.mp3

FIND: (\d{4}) (.*)(\.mp3)
REPLACE: \2_\1\3
  
Georgia Horseshoe_0001.mp3
Billy In The Lowground_0002.mp3
Cherokee Shuffle_0003.mp3
Walking Cane_0004.mp3
```

Question 4: Here is a data frame with genus, species, and two numeric variables.
```
Camponotus,pennsylvanicus,10.2,44
Camponotus,herculeanus,10.5,3
Myrmica,punctiventris,12.2,4
Lasius,neoniger,3.3,55

#Write a single regular expression to rearrange the data set like this:

C_pennsylvanicus,44
C_herculeanus,3
M_punctiventris,4
L_neoniger,55

FIND: (\w),(\w+),(\w+),.+,(.+)
REPLACE: \1_\3,\4
```

Beginning with the original expression, rearrange it to abbreviate the species name like this:
```
C_penn,44
C_herc,3
M_punc,4
L_neon,55

FIND: (\w)(\w+),(\w{4})(\w+),(.+),(\d{1,2})
REPLACE: \1_\3,\6
```
